# JavaScript Loose vs. Strict Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common bug in JavaScript related to loose versus strict comparison operators when handling null and undefined values.

The `bug.js` file contains code that uses loose comparison (`==`), leading to incorrect handling of null and undefined. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code using strict comparison (`===`).

## Bug Description
The original code attempts to differentiate between null, undefined, numbers, and objects; however, loose comparison causes unexpected results.  The loose comparison `==` allows type coercion, leading to unexpected truthiness or falsiness, particularly when comparing to null or undefined.

## Solution
The solution involves replacing loose comparisons with strict comparisons (`===`). Strict comparison prevents type coercion and ensures accurate comparison of values and types.
